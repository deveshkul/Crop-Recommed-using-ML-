Python is used for model development, data preprocessing, and web app development. Scikit-learn handles model training, evaluation, and prediction. Pandas is for data manipulation and analysis, while NumPy deals with numerical computing and arrays. Flask is the web framework for building user interfaces and handling HTTP requests. HTML/CSS design the web interface, and JavaScript enhances client-side interactions and user experience. Together, these tools create a robust machine learning application.
